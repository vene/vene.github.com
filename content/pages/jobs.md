# Open PhD Position

I am recruiting one PhD candidate
in **machine learning for natural language processing**
at the University of Amsterdam. 
Apply before Nov 19, 2020. Read the details and follow the application
instructions
[here](https://ivi.uva.nl/shared/uva/en/vacancies/2020/10/20-612-phd-position-in-machine-learning-for-natural-language-processing.html).[ref]The application form has a "number of publications" field. 
I can't remove it. Publications are not required, leave that field at zero.[/ref]

This is a ML for NLP position with some topic flexibility. Some ideas for linguistic
phenomena we might study, depending on your interests, are

 - discourse and argumentation structure;
 - conversation modelling;
 - coreference;
 - syntactic and semantic structure;
 - generation with constraints;
 - multilinguality.

We will rely on a selection of machine learning techniques. My research
gravitates around structured prediction, latent variable models, sparsity,
convex and constrained optimization, and geometry (machine learning on
manifolds.) Importantly, **I am not looking for an expert in these ML topics.**
But if you have ML basics and you are enthusiastic to study one or more of these
(or related) topics, together with me, in order to apply them in NLP research, 
you are a perfect fit!

The flavor of my research is to integrate structured and discrete
representations into the ``soft'' computation of neural networks.
See this captured in my [recent papers](/papers.html).

# Advising Statement

It's a good idea to be skeptical about working with an advisor who is early in
their career. Talking to their other students is always good: I am currently co-advising
[Tsvetomila Mihaylova](https://tsvm.github.io/)
and [Gon√ßalo M. Correia](https://goncalomcorreia.github.io/).
You can also write to me with any questions.

The PhD is a job, and, [at UvA, PhD students are employees](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/working-at-the-uva/terms-of-employment/terms-of-employment.html),
with the workers' rights
that stem from this. 
I believe your PhD is not your entire life and identity. I encourage and try to
actively demonstrate [work-life
balance](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/working-at-the-uva/terms-of-employment/work-and-personal-life/work-and-personal-life.html), awareness and support of mental health struggles,
inclusivity, openness and safety.
The PhD is the time to learn how to learn, ask,
answer, describe, and teach. I will help and mentor you through it,
according to my ability and your requested level.
