# Open Positions and Opportunities

I am recruiting one Ph.D. student at the University of Amsterdam. Details and
topics will be developed here soon, but generally will revolve around
optimization, sparsity, and structured prediction, for NLP.  The opening will be
announced in the fall of 2020.  Feel free to contact me in advance if
interested.
