# Open PhD Position

I am recruiting one PhD candidate
in **machine learning for natural language processing**
at the University of Amsterdam. 
Apply before Nov 19 2020. Read the details and follow the application
instructions
[here](https://ivi.uva.nl/shared/uva/en/vacancies/2020/10/20-612-phd-position-in-machine-learning-for-natural-language-processing.html).

This is an NLP position with some flexibility. My past and present main areas of interests are:
 
 - Structured prediction;
 - Latent variable models (especially discrete & structured);
 - Convex and constrained optimization;
 - Geometry: machine learning on manifolds.

**I am not looking for an expert in any of the above.** I only ask for
ML basics, and excitement for studying some topics like the above,
together with me, in order to use them in our research.

The flavor of my research is to integrate structured and discrete
representations into the ``soft'' computation of neural networks.
See this captured in my [recent papers](/papers.html).

# Advising Statement

It's a good idea to be skeptical about working with an advisor who is early in
their career. Talking to their other students is always good: I am currently co-advising
[Tsvetomila Mihaylova](https://tsvm.github.io/)
and [Gon√ßalo M. Correia](https://goncalomcorreia.github.io/).
You can also (with a grain of salt) write to me with any questions.

The PhD is a job, and, [at UvA, PhD students are employees](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/working-at-the-uva/terms-of-employment/terms-of-employment.html),
with the workers' rights
that stem from this. 
I believe your PhD is not your entire life and identity. I encourage and try to
actively demonstrate [work-life
balance](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/working-at-the-uva/terms-of-employment/work-and-personal-life/work-and-personal-life.html), awareness and support of mental health struggles,
inclusivity, openness and safety.
The PhD is the time to learn how to learn, ask,
answer, describe, and teach. I will help and mentor you through it,
according to my ability and your requested level.
