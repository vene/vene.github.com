Hi! I'm Vlad, and I'm a postdoc within [DeepSPIN](https://deep-spin.github.io/)
at the [Instituto de Telecomunicações](https://www.it.pt), Lisbon, Portugal.
I research machine learning & natural language processing, focusing on sparsity
and structure.

I obtained my PhD from [Cornell](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/) in 2018,
advised by [Claire Cardie](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/).
I am a [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) core dev/alum and
I develop the [polylearn](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/polylearn)
library for factorization machines and polynomial networks in Python.
