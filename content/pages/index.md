Hi! I'm Vlad [he/him]. I'm an assistant professor in the
[Informatics Institute (IvI), University of Amsterdam](https://ivi.uva.nl/).
I research machine learning & natural language processing, focusing on sparsity
and structure.

I'm proud to be a co-advisor of PhD students [Tsvetomila Mihaylova](https://tsvm.github.io/)
and [Gonçalo M. Correia](https://goncalomcorreia.github.io/).

and then post-docced in the
